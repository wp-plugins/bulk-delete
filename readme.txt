Bulk delete posts from selected categories, tags or custom taxonomies

== Description ==

Bulk Delete is a WordPress Plugin which can be used to delete posts in bulk from selected categories, tags or custom taxonomies. This Plugin can also delete all drafts, post revisions or pages.

### Features

This Plugin supports the following bulk delete options

- Delete posts by category
- Delete posts by tags
- Delete posts by custom taxonomies
- Delete posts by url
- Delete all pages
- Delete all post revisions
- Delete all pending posts
- Delete all private posts
- Delete all drafts

All the above options support the following filters

- Post date greater than X days
- Post date less than X days
- Only public posts
- Only private posts
- Restrict to first Y posts
- Schedule deletion of posts automatically (Available as a Pro addon)

As you can see, the Plugin provide comprehensive options and filters to perform bulk deletion.

If you looking for just moving posts, instead of deleting, then use [Bulk Move Plugin][2] instead.

### Pro Addons

The following are the list of pro addons that are currently available.

#### Bulk Delete Schedule Categories

This addon adds the ability to schedule auto delete of categories. This will be really useful, if you have to delete posts based on categories on a regular basis.

The cost of this addon is $15 and you can buy it through [paypal](http://sudarmuthu.com/out/bulk-delete-category-addon).

== Credits ==

This Plugin uses the following JavaScript library

- [Time picker addon](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/)

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installing the Plugin, I just see a blank page. =

This can happen if you have huge number of posts and your server is very underpowered. Check your PHP error log to see if there are any errors and correct them. The most common problems are script timeout or running out of memory. Change your PHP.ini file and increase the script timeout and/or amount of memory used by PHP process.

In particular try to change the following settings

*   `max_execution_time = 600` - Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
*   `max_input_time = 30` - Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
*   `memory_limit = 256M` - Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

= How do I know what are the current values for these options configured in my server? =

Scroll down to the button of the Plugin page and you can see the current values of these options printed for your reference under the “Debug Information” heading

= Is it possible to restore the posts that I have deleted through the Plugin?  =

If you choose the option "Move to trash" then you can find them from trash. But if you choose "Delete permanently", then it is not possible to retrieve the posts. So be **very careful**.

= Is it possible to schedule deletion of posts =

The ability to schedule deletion of posts is available as a pro addon.
