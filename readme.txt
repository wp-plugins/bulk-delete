== Credits ==

Thanks <a href="http://www.martincapodici.com">Martin Capodici</a> for providing the code to implement the "delete specific page" feature.

Thanks to [Time picker addon](http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/) JavaScript library, which the Plugin uses.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= After installing the Plugin, I just see a blank page. =

This can happen if you have huge number of posts and your server is very underpowered. Check your PHP error log to see if there are any errors and correct them. The most common problems are script timeout or running out of memory. Change your PHP.ini file and increase the script timeout and/or amount of memory used by PHP process.

In particular try to change the following settings

*   `max_execution_time = 600` - Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
*   `max_input_time = 30` - Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
*   `memory_limit = 256M` - Maximum amount of memory a script may consume

You can also try to disable different sections of the Plugin, if you have huge number of posts.

= How do I disable different sections of the Plugin =

You can enable or disable different sections of the Plugin by choosing the required modules in the screen option. You can open screen options by clicking the link in the top right corner of the Plugin page.

= How do I know what are the current values for these options configured in my server? =

Scroll down to the button of the Plugin page and you can see the current values of these options printed for your reference under the “Debug Information” heading

= Is it possible to restore the posts that I have deleted through the Plugin?  =

If you choose the option "Move to trash" then you can find them from trash. But if you choose "Delete permanently", then it is not possible to retrieve the posts. So be **very careful**.

= Is it possible that some Plugin are not compatible with Bulk Delete? =

Yes. If a Plugin rewrites the query vars by using `add_filter( 'pre_get_posts' )` then it may be incompatible with this Plugin. [The event calendar](http://wordpress.org/plugins/the-events-calendar/) is one such Plugin.

I currently disable and enable the `pre_get_posts` filter if I find that "The event calendar" Plugin is installed. It is not ideal, but it gets the work done. If you find any other Plugin with which Bulk Delete doesn't work, then let me know and I will try to see if I can add support through some hack like this.

= Is it possible to schedule deletion of posts =

The ability to schedule deletion of posts is available as a pro addon.
